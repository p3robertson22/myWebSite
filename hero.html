<p> Paragraph 1
<br/>
Kobe Bryant was known as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. In the beginning of 2020 Kobe unfortunately passed away in a helicopter crash along with his daughter Gigi and a few other people in the helicopter. He played in the NBA for 20 years, and played every season with the Los Angles Lakers. He was considered to be on of the best basketball players of all time. Kobe was born on August 23, 1978 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was an amazing basketball player growing up and right out of high school he was drafted into the NBA. In 1996 he was the 13th pick in the first round of the draft, he was selected by the Charlotte Hornet then shortly after he was traded to the Lakers.


<p>Paragraph 2
<br/>
I considers Kobe to be one of my heroes because he faced so many hardships in his life and was able to push though them and thrive. I am one of many athlete that looks up to Kobe Bryant. His open mindset and drive to succeed is what inspires me the most. Not only was Kobe an amazing basketball player, but he has created many opportunities for young athletes who are passionate about basketball. He made what is called Mamba Basketball Club based out of Los Angles, California. Not only is it a basketball club he also made it into a volleyball club as well because it was the sport that his daughter wanted to play and he has always been very interested in the sport. I admire Kobe Bryant for his way of playing sports and his willingness to create opportunity for others.
