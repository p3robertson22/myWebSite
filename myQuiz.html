/*************** Algorithm ******************
1. Program all variables, testing to make sure the website **still** works after all of them are defined
2. Create functions, displayQuestion will be first, then update score, and then checkanswer
3. displayQuestion will loop every time the button is clicked, and it's job is to change the question
4. The user will submit their answer in a text box, and their answer will be stored in a new array. Once they focus out, the update score function will run
5. The update score function will utilize the checkAnswer function, in order to check if the answer is right or not. 
6. Once the true or false is returned into updatescore, the score will be updated and the cycle continues.
